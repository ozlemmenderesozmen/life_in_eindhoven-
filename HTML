        <p class="text-of-places right"><strong>Groene Woud</strong><br> In the middle of North Brabant, between Eindhoven, Tilburg and 's-Hertogenbosch, lies the Groene Woud: beautiful wet nature with its own character.<br><br>
        Wijboschbroek, near Schijndel, is one of those wet forest areas in the middle of fields and meadows. The large quantities of poplars that were planted here for the clog industry are striking.<br><br> 
        The wealth of plants and birds is just as varied. Just like in the other areas of the Green Forest, it is also wonderful to walk here. Wear boots in winter, bring mosquito repellent in summer!</p>

        <p class="text-of-places right"><strong>Heeze-Leende</strong><br>Leende owns the Leende forestry; Heeze has the Strabrechtse Heide. Together two immense nature reserves to wander around endlessly, located in the south of Brabant. The forestry consists largely of coniferous trees. Heather, fens, drifting dunes, winding paths and farms provide an ever-changing view.<br><br>
        And then the Strabrechtse Heide in Heeze. At first glance you think you see an immense plain of bushes and heather, but nothing could be further from the truth. Around the fens - the Beuven is the largest fen in the Netherlands! - special plants such as water spoon and carnivorous sundew grow. Get down on your knees to admire these and other beautiful bloomers.</p>

        <p class="text-of-places right"><strong>Speelbossen (Play Forests)</strong><br>       Climb and scramble in the play forests.<br><br>
        <strong>What is a play forest?</strong><br>The speelbos is a public playground and meeting place for children and families. It is a link between education, experience and movement. Think of self-build huts, a water pump with mud pool, climbing trees, swing rope and rope bridge. It is above all a place to experience something, but also to create yourself.<br><br>

        <p class="text-of-places right"><strong>Kabouterpaden (Gnome Paths)</strong><br>Go out with your gnome and look for traces of gnomes in the forest.<br><br>
        <strong>What is a gnome path?</strong><br>
Gnome trails are fun and educational treasure hunts for children from 3 to 7 years old. But older children who still believe in gnomes are also welcome. Wearing a pointed hat, red cheeks and a knapsack, they go outside in search of gnome trails and carry out assignments. They can then take that pointed hat home with them.<br><br>
